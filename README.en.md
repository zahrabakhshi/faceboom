######  Because this project belongs to [boomisazan Intelligent processing qaem](https://boomi-sazan.ir/faceboom_beta2/) company, it is not possible to share the codes and I will only introduce the implemented project.

Facebook software is designed to record the processes related to the attendance of employees of large organizations. In each organization, a local Windows data processing and storage unit is defined and the faces of the employees of this building are introduced to the system. Local data processing and storage units send their information online and through the internal network to the main server of the software. In the context of the internal network of the relevant organization, a network automation system (web application) is designed and installed, and using it, reporting and monitoring processes are defined as managerial and employee and in the context of the network.

##  Management Supervision Solution
For accounting, manpower, and management units, independent usernames are defined, and these units can view employee reports by department, time period, or individual name. These reports can be changed and customized depending on the needs and demands of the organization. Employee requests, including leave requests or requests to register missions and overtime, can be managed by this monitoring solution, designed through an automation system.

## Employee Supervision Solution
For each employee of the organization, a personal username and password are defined that they can use to view their personal page in the Facebook presence and absence automation system. In this personal page, in addition to viewing your attendance reports (with various reporting capabilities), which are registered through the Facebook traffic control system at the entrance of the organization, it is possible to request leave registration or mission registration. If the management approves, this request will be entered into the information of the attendance system and can be seen and followed in the reports.
